Automatically assigns labels to GitHub issues.

This repository presents our work towards our transfer learning framework for classifying GitHub issues. The organization of this repository is as follows:-

- The directory 'data' contains the notebooks we use to extract repositories, and further github issues for our sampleset.
- The notebook 'model.ipynb' contains the filtering, cleaning, model contruction, training and evaluation tasks for our ML pipeline.
- The directory 'app' contains the source for the GitHub app
- The 'requirements.txt' contains all the python packages that we use
