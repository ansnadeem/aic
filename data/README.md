The order of execution is as follows:-

1- Repositories are collected by executing the 'Extract repos' notebook.
These repositories are then saved in a csv file in the same directly, named 'repos.csv' by default

2- Issues from the repositories extracted in the first step are collected by running the 'Extract issues' notebook.
This fetches information for the repositories such as body, description, labels, etc.
